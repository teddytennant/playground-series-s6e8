"""Read which submissions are currently flagged as final selections.

Kaggle's public API has no *write* path for final-submission selection (probed and
falsified 2026-08-13, see RESEARCH.md), but it does expose a read: ListSubmissions
accepts group=SUBMISSION_GROUP_SELECTED. That gives a verification channel for the
one action this competition still needs a human for.

Usage:  .venv/bin/python experiments/check_selection.py
        (needs the kaggle CLI's OAuth credentials at $KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR)

Exit status 1 if nothing is selected, so it can be used as a deadline alarm.
